This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Vertebrate Zoology](https://vertebrate-zoology.arphahub.com/).

**Vertebrate Zoology** (formerly Zoologische Abhandlungen) is a scientific journal published by the Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung. The journal is published online according to the Creative Commons Licence. Only manuscripts in English language are considered for publication.

Research fields covered by Vertebrate Zoology are taxonomy, morphology, anatomy, phylogeny (molecular and morphology-based), historical biogeography, and palaeontology of vertebrates. Original contributions as well as reviews are welcome. Descriptions of new taxa should be integrated into a proper context (e.g. complete revision of a taxon, phylogenetic or biogeographical framework). Studied specimens have to be deposited in a public scientific collection to allow re-examination and reproducibility of results. We no longer consider single species descriptions unless they are part of a comprehensive framework of broader taxonomic revisions or concern taxa of exceptional and wider interest.
